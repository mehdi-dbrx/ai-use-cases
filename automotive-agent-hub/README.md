## ðŸš˜ MCP Agent Hub (Automotive Industry)

| **Industry:** Automotive / Vehicle Manufacturing

ðŸŽ¯ What it does

Centralizes AI service orchestration for automotive parts fabrication, enabling heterogeneous agents across multiple providers to interact seamlessly. Supports both Databricks-managed MCP and custom MCP servers for vector search and AI tool integration.

ðŸ’¡ The Challenge
	â€¢	Multiple AI agents developed in different environments needed a unified access point
	â€¢	Calls to Genie vector search and UC tools had to be seamlessly integrated
	â€¢	Required hybrid deployment: leveraging Databricks-managed MCP while supporting custom MCP servers for external services
	â€¢	Ensured scalability, reliability, and consistent API across heterogeneous environments

ðŸ”¥ Key Results
	â€¢	âœ… Centralized AI service orchestration across diverse environments
	â€¢	âœ… Hybrid MCP deployment combining Databricks-managed and custom servers
	â€¢	âœ… Integrated vector search (Genie) and UC tools into workflows
	â€¢	âœ… Enabled AI services access both internally and externally, boosting flexibility
